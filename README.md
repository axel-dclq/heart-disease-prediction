# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health indicators. The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset). The project includes a Jupyter Notebook containing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data visualizations, and machine learning models.

## Project Background

This project was collaboratively undertaken as part of my studies at the Technical University of Riga. It served as a practical application of data science and machine learning concepts learned during the coursework. The collaborative effort involved leveraging each team member's skills in data analysis, visualization, and model building.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of several health-related features, including age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. The target variable is binary, indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Files

- `heart_disease_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis, including EDA, data visualizations, and machine learning models.
- `cardio_train.csv`: the dataset I used for this project.
